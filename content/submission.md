<!--* Download a PDF version of the [second call for papers](http://arg.napier.ac.uk/events/cmna/assets/cfp/cfp2.pdf)-->


The workshop encourages submissions in four categories:

* Long papers, either reporting on completed work or offering a polemic discussion on a burning issue (up to 10 pages).
* Short papers describing work in progress (up to 5 pages).
* Demos (2 page abstract describing the demo)
* Posters (2 page abstract explaining the concept behind the poster).

It is highly recommended, but not mandatory, to format papers using the [Springer LNCS format](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines). Paper submission will be handled by the Easychair conference system. Please submit your paper here via easychair:

# Proceedings Submission

After the workshop we plan to publish proceedings for CMNA 21 through [CEUR Workshop Proceedings](http://ceur-ws.org/) as has happened in previous years. Usually we use the style of our parent or partner conference but there is no such thing this year so for final proceedings submission after the workshop we'll use the new [CEUR styles](https://ceurws.wordpress.com/2020/03/31/ceurws-publishes-ceurart-paper-style/) specifically the single column styles from [this page](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/).

The workshop encourages submissions in four categories:

* Long papers, either reporting on completed work or offering a polemic discussion on a burning issue (up to 10 pages).
* Short papers describing work in progress (up to 5 pages).
* Demos (2 page abstract describing the demo)
* Posters (2 page abstract explaining the concept behind the poster).

It is highly recommended, but not mandatory, to format papers using the [Springer LNCS format](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines). Paper submission will be handled by the Easychair conference system. Please submit your paper here via easychair:

We plan to publish proceedings for CMNA 21 through [CEUR Workshop Proceedings](http://ceur-ws.org/) as has happened in previous years.
